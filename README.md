# Commonly asked questions

### What is pyCommand?
pyCommand is a solo project that was originally created to be a replica of command prompt with extra features, I originally started working on this project when I was still fairly new to [Python](https://www.python.org/) About over 3 years ago, I actually forgot about this project on my USB for quite some time ðŸ˜… but I'm moving back onto this project.

### Whats the point of pyCommand?
Theres multible points for pyCommand, for a start its fast and effiencent ensuring your not going to get unexpected lag or crashes. for example running `dir/s` in normal command prompt it takes acouple of seconds to list your directories while pyCommand will spit it out to you all in one go allowing you to quickly find what your looking for, not only does it do that it also includes a search feature triggered with `Ctrl + F` this will bring up PyCommands search feature, making finding what you need with lots of output a dream.

### What were those extra features you mentioned?
Not only does pyCommand support basic command prompt features, it supports the ability to fully customise it with mods, yes you heard me mods for a command prompt replica, this opens it up to alot more possibilities such as creating games, extra features, and customising the UI design.
